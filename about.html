            <h2>Research & Extracurriculars</h2>
            <p>Beyond academics, I have actively contributed to research projects in Reinforcement Learning, working on topics like strategic decision-making, nonstationary environments, and neural network-based optimization. My work has given me hands-on experience with advanced machine learning techniques, experimentation, and data analysis.</p>
            <p>In addition, I am a full-stack developer at JumboCode, a student-led organization where I collaborate with teams to develop software solutions for non-profits. Through this experience, I have honed my ability to work in agile development environments, participate in code reviews, and contribute to impactful projects that serve the community.</p>
